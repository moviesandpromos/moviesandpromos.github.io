<h1>StockWise - Terms of Use & Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>Terms of Use</h2>
<p>StockWise is an educational platform designed to help users better understand stock market trends, technical indicators, and momentum based on historical data and user-driven analysis.</p>

<p>StockWise does <strong>not provide any investment advice, stock recommendations, portfolio management, or brokerage services</strong>. The app does not offer personalized advice to any user and is not a substitute for professional financial advice from a SEBI-registered investment advisor.</p>

<p>All content and AI-powered insights shown in this app — including trends, stock momentum, contest rankings, or AI models — are for <strong>informational and educational purposes only</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>We are not a SEBI-registered investment advisor.</strong> You should always consult a SEBI-registered investment advisor before making any investment decisions.</p>

<p>By using StockWise, you acknowledge and agree to these Terms of Use.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy (AI System)</h2>

<p>When you use StockWise, we may collect anonymous app usage data — including stock picks made during contests and aggregated interaction patterns — to help train and improve our AI models.</p>

<p>We use Google Authentication for secure login. We do not store passwords on our servers. We only collect and store your name and email address associated with your Google account.</p>

<p>You can update your displayed name at any time through the MySpace section of the app. Your email address is used solely for account identification and communication purposes.</p>
<p>This data is used in an <strong>aggregated and anonymized manner</strong>, solely to improve educational content and platform features. We do <strong>not</strong> collect personal financial transactions or link this data to any trading account.</p>

<p>We do <strong>not sell or share</strong> this data with third parties. It is used only within the StockWise platform to enhance educational offerings.</p>

<p>By participating in contests or using AI features, you consent to this anonymous use of app interactions.</p>

<h2>How Our AI Learns</h2>

<p>Our AI system is trained on two types of data:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Historical stock market trends</li>
    <li>User interactions within the app — such as contest picks, stock rankings, and trend ratings</li>
</ul>

<p>This helps our AI identify market patterns and build smarter educational tools for our users.</p>

<p>⚠️ <strong>Important:</strong> The AI does <strong>not predict future stock prices</strong> or guarantee returns. It simply highlights patterns in the market and among user behavior — to help users learn and make more informed decisions.</p>

<p>By using StockWise, you are helping our AI models grow smarter. Thank you for your contribution!</p>

<h2>AI Participation Consent</h2>

<p>By participating in contests or using AI-powered features, you agree that your stock picks may be anonymously used to improve our AI educational models.</p>
<p>No personal financial data or linked trading accounts are used. All AI data is anonymized and used purely to enhance learning features on StockWise.</p>

<h2>Community Guidelines</h2>

<p>Do not impersonate financial experts or claim to be SEBI-registered unless verified.
No direct messaging of unsolicited tips or schemes.
Marketing or selling financial products/services is prohibited.
User-generated content (portfolios, watchlists, branding pages) must not promise returns.</p>

<p>Violation of these rules can result in suspension or permanent ban of your account.</p>

<h2>For Learn Mode Users</h2>

<p>The educational content in Learn Mode covers general stock market concepts and is not customized to individual financial goals or risk profiles. It is designed for conceptual clarity, not trading recommendations.</p>

<h2>Subscription Disclaimer</h2>

<p>Any fee we charge gives access to advanced technical tools, learning modules, and leaderboard-based gamification.
It does not guarantee stock returns, nor does it entitle you to personalized financial recommendations.
No refunds are issued based on stock performance or algorithmic signals.</p>
